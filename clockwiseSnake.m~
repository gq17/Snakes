function Q = clockwiseSnake(P)
% This function would make the snake clockwise. It is different from the
% MakeContourClockwise2D, it's more powerful in fact. it will correct the
% points wich are irregular(forming twists) in the snakes. This function is
% created to use the last snake as the initialization for current round.

%
% Input&Output
% P: the original snake
% Q: the clockwised snake
